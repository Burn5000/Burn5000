### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yusuf Mohamed. I am currently a student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities majoring in computer science and minoring in geographic information systems. This repository contains projects I worked on in class or on my own. I am driven to make a difference in the world and 
expand my skills in software development. I am open to new oppurtunities, whether it be a project, internship, or just brainstorming ideas.
