### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yusuf Mohamed. I am currently a student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities majoring in computer science and minoring in history. I am driven to make a difference in the world and 
expand my skills in software development. I am open to new oppurtunities, whether it be a project, internship, or just brainstorming ideas.
